# Data and Code Repository

This repository hosts the data and code used for the empirical analysis in _Interdiscipline as Language: A Structural Topic Model Approach to Academic Production in Sustainability Science_, by Roberto Velazquez-Quiroz, Julien Vanhulst, Alejandro Espinosa-Rada, and Roberto Cantillan (2025).

# Materials

The .zip file contains all materials supporting the analysis. The file contains: 

1.- PAPER CODE – TMRS / Two Mode Relational Simmilarity
Estimation followed the procedures described and presented by 
Lizardo, O. (2024). Two-mode relational similarities. Social Networks, 76, 34–41. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.06.002

Data Availability:
The following code reproduces the TMRS (Two-Mode Relational Similarity) results.
The dataset is publicly available on the GitHub repository of the paper and 
consists of four edgelists, each representing the corpus for a specific period.

2.- PAPER CODE – STM / Structural Topic Model
Estimation followed the procedures described and presented by  Roberts ME, Stewart BM, Tingley D. stm: An R Package for Structural Topic
Models. Journal of Statistical Software. 2019;91:1–40. doi:10.18637/jss.v091.i02.

Data Availability:
The following code reproduces the STM (Structural Topic Model) results.
The dataset is publicly available on the GitHub repository of the paper and 
consists of four tables, each representing the corpus for a specific period.
